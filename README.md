Flying Router is a Router implementation.

- **Dynamic**: Flying Router lets you decide what the type of your request and response is.
- **Resource Efficient**: With the small size amd the focus on small environments, Flying Router doesn't waste resources on features needed only in enterprise environments.
- **Simple**: The router has a very simple structure where you can define everything with only a few lines of code

To install Flying Router you have to execute the following command:

```sh
